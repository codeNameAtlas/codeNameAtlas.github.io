Hi! I am Alex and I'm glad to see you here ðŸ™‚

I'm an **experienced customer-facing engineer** that loves helping people, solving business and technical problems, evangelizing complex technical concepts in a clear and concise manner, designing robust data and implementation architecture solutions, and who wants to be a major factor in the success of your customers.

I'm comfortable interacting with multiple languages, web frameworks, APIs, data warehouses, SQL queries, and more. A few development languages that I have production experience working with are: **GO, JavaScript, Python, PHP, NodeJS, Ruby, iOS, and Android.**


### If you're curious...

I'm also an avid traveler, experience seeker, and an active member of my community. I love any type of activity that involves people, movement, or getting outdoors. â€‹

A few years ago in the Himalayas, I hiked with some friends for **18 days** around **Mt. Everest** with only a compass and a map as our guide. We learned to work together, trust each other, and that we could push our limits much further. *Always try new things and don't fear failure.*

### Contact me

Want to talk solutions architecture, solutions engineering, personal development, or adventure? **Reach out!** If I'm not able to help you, I'd love to connect you with someone who can and if you have something to offer, I'd love to learn from you too.
